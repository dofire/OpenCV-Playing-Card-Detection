- find the card
- isolate the corners
- split it into rank and suit

## Setup (for testing)
- run `installation.ipynb` to install the required packages (or install packages manually)
- setup local `venv` or anaconda env, then hit run `main.py` (or just use `main.ipynb` instead)
- **(For Testing)** Because the `test` folder is quite large (100+ MB), you guys will have to download the `.zip` folder and then extract it into the root directory in order to test the code, which is under `releases` section

## Used Packages
- `Python 3.11.5`
- `opencv`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter notebook`
